# Project Overview
Our project is a bias checker built specifically for the use of information spread by means of social media. The objectives are to promote media literacy, present balanced views and opinions to counter polarizing viewpoints, and enhance content transparency. Our audience would consist of social media users, with special emphasis on age groups particularly susceptible to false/generated content. Our motivation behind this project was to counter misinformation and fear mongering in tumultuous times, such as the current political climate, to lead to a more well-informed society.
